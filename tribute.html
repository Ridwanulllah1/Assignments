      <h2 id="img-caption">Born in Beirut, Lebanon in 1964,Keanu Reeves has been a Hollywood fixture since the mid-1980s, shifting from early dramatic turns in films like River’s Edge (1986) to action thrillers like Speed (1994), The Matrix (1999), and John Wick (2014) and an indelible performance as Theodore “Ted” Logan in the Bill & Ted franchise.</h2>

      <h3>Below, are few mind-blowing facts about this gentle soul</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> <b>ONE OF KEANU REEVES’S EARLIEST ROLES WAS IN A COCA-COLA COMMERCIAL:-</b> After getting parts on stage and Canadian television, Reeves landed a part as a cyclist in a Coke commercial in the 1980s. In 2018, The Late Late Show host James Corden asked the actor about the gig; Reeves remembered shooting over a three-day period, during which he drank “so many Coca-Colas.” In full commitment to the role, he also shaved his legs to look more believable as a cyclist.</li>

        <li> <b>KEANU REEVES HAS A DEEP LOVE OF MOTORCYCLES:-</b> Reeves first learned to ride a motorcycle while shooting a film in Germany, and purchased one for himself the moment he returned to the U.S. His favorite bike is the 1973 Norton Commando.</li>

        <li> <b>KEANU REEVES ALSO HAS AN EXTENSIVE HISTORY OF MOTORCYCLE-RELATED INJURIES:- </b>If Reeves doesn’t ride his bike as fast (or often) as he used to, it’s because he’s been in a number of serious accidents while riding them. He has lost teeth, broken his ankle, gotten road rash, and ruptured his spleen, amongst other injuries.</li>

        <li> <b>KEANU REEVES HAS BEEN WILLING TO DEFER HIS SALARY TO GET OTHER ACTORS IN HIS MOVIES:-</b> Reeves has worked with an impressive list of actors in his career, including Al Pacino (1997’s The Devil’s Advocate), Gene Hackman (2000’s The Replacements), and Jack Nicholson (2003’s Something’s Gotta Give). In at least the first two instances, Reeves willingly deferred his compensation in order for the productions to free up some of their budget to be able to afford the actors.</li>
    
      <li> <b>KEANU REEVES’S COMMERCIAL SUCCESS HAS RESULTED IN HIM SUBSIDIZING MORE THAN JUST A FEW HIGH-PROFILE CASTING CHOICES:- </b>Beyond deferring paychecks to work alongside the likes of Pacino and Nicholson, Reeves has earned more than enough money to live comfortably for the rest of his life with a net worth reportedly along the lines of $360 million. But he gave away a portion of his salary for The Matrix sequels to provide more money for the visual effects and costume departments</li>

      <li> <b>KEANU REEVES HAS BEEN INJURED OR SIDELINED BY ILLNESS MULTIPLE TIMES DURING SHOOTING:- </b>Reeves is known to be a trouper when it comes to shooting through pain, disability, and sickness, and his dedication to his colleagues is legendary. Several of his co-stars on The Matrix were injured during the wire work sequences on the film, and Reeves dealt with a spinal injury during filming when two of the discs in his back began to fuse together.</li>

      <li> <b>KEANU REEVES SAYS TURNING DOWN SPEED 2 PUT HIM IN “MOVIE JAIL” FOR 10 YEARS:- </b>After the success of 1994’s Speed, where Reeves portrayed a cop trying to save the lives of people trapped on a bus rigged to explode if it dips below 50 miles an hour, the studio was understandably eager for a sequel. At the time he was shown the script, Reeves was shooting the 1996 action film Chain Reaction and was growing wary of roles where he was “running and jumping” for little to no reason.</li>

      <li> <b>KEANU REEVES ONLY BECAME A PART OF KEANU AT THE LAST MINUTE:- </b> <i>John Wick</i> and the 2014 action-comedy Keanu were developed independently from one another, and early reporting about the latter film indicated it was a parody of the former. Consequently, Reeves’s management turned down an offer for the actor to appear in Keanu without even notifying their client.</li>

      <li> <b>IT’S POSSIBLE THAT KEANU REEVES ACCIDENTALLY MARRIED WINONA RYDER:- </b>While shooting 1992’s Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Reeves and Winona Ryder—who played Jonathan and Mina Harker, respectively—appear in a scene in which their characters get married. Ryder later pointed out that director Francis Ford Coppola used a real priest in the scene and that both actors said their vows, meaning they might actually be married. </li>

      <li> <b>KEANU REEVES WAS TRICKED INTO APPEARING IN THE WATCHER:- </b>In 2000’s The Watcher, Reeves plays against his typical onscreen affability as a serial killer in a cat-and-mouse game with a detective (James Spader). According to Reeves, he was actually tricked into appearing in the film when a (presumably former) friend forged his signature on the contract.</li>
